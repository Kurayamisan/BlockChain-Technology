            <p> The most important benefits of blockchain technology are data assurance authentication, data redundancy, transparency of transactions on the network, and the ability to create smart contracts. Blockchains store data in a unique manner as compare to other technologies. Data is store with each of the peers in the network so no one person has the ability to edit the electronic ledger this secures the redundancy of the data. In an example of the power of this electronic ledger. “[i]n war-torn Syria, Iranian-Backed Shia settlers have invaded the country, claiming lands where former Sunni residents once resided. To prevent displaced Sunni residents from reclaiming their land, Shia settles have systematically torched land registry offices across the country. Had Syria implemented a blockchain-based land registry on a widely supported blockchain – such as bitcoin – before the conflict erupted, the torching would have had little effect. Because of the resilient nature of the blockchain, even if flames engulfed Syria’s traditional land registry system—and even if Syrian data centers were destroyed—copies of ownership records would remain safely stored on the computers of miners scattered across the globe who support the Bitcoin network. Because a blockchain is resistant to change, had Shia settlers taken control of the Syrian land registry directly and illegitimately assigned land to new Shia residents, displaced Syrians could still prove their previous ownership claims once the conflict subsided. By relying on the sequentially ordered records maintained in the Bitcoin blockchain, any displaced Syrian resident could use a blockchain to support a legal action to reclaim their land” (De Pilippi, P., and Wright, A. 2018) because there would be not one centralized point of attack on the blockchain the data is safe from being remove or edited by malicious actors. Data inside a blockchain network is verify using Private-Public key encryptions and digital signatures. Here is the process as “[b]efore engaging in a transaction with a smart contract or another member of a blockchain-based network, a party must sign the transaction with their private key. The digital signature serves as evidence that an account initiated a transaction, narrowing the ability of the holder of a blockchain-based account to refute the fact that a transaction occurred, unless a party can prove that the private key associated with the account was somehow compromised” as described in Characteristics of Blockchains (De Pilippi, P., and Wright, A. 2018), authentication of a transaction is one of the features of blockchain technology that is key to its extensive use and confidence on the system. Being able to verify a transaction and the transparency in which this is done is a major feature of the blockchain technology, take for instance the following situation. A known party had received multiple payments in the form of bitcoin to a known address, later this party was suspected to have died and disappear due to the lack of activity on the network. The party in question in order to verify that he was alive use the network to send out a series of transaction origination from this well known address with a note stating he was well, “the blockchain provided the necessary infrastructure to prove the integrity of the message and the authenticity of its source in a way that could not be repudiated” (De Pilippi, P., and Wright, A. 2018). With smart contracts we can reduce the burden or verification from public and private entities by encoding legal and contractual provisions “into simple and deterministic code-base rules that will automatically execute by the underlying blockchain network” (De Pilippi, P., and Wright, A. 2018). Using code to enforce the law and contracts can help reduce the burden of record keeping from our private and public entities. Tax collection for example could be streamline into a simple process. Sales tax could be collected and remitted to directly to the government after each transaction, a smart contract can be set to submit the percentage allocated after each completed transaction by the store to the government. </p>

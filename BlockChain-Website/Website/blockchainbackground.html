            <p> The technology behind Blockchain exhibits the following set of characteristics: relies on a peer to peer network, uses public-private key cryptography, and it uses consensus mechanisms. Relying in a peer to peer network allows for everyone on the network to have a copy of the public ledger and all the transaction that were recorded in it, thus not needing to have a central database with a single point of failure. Using Public-Private cryptography allows for secure transaction to take place placed between individuals. The consensus mechanisms assembled within the blockchain support a tamper resistant data structure in which the system foundation is based on “[m]ost if not all blockchain-based networks feature market-based or game-theoretical mechanism for reaching consensus” (De Pilippi, P., and Wright, A. 2018). These blockchain features explain why this technology is so powerful and the impact is having on today society. The aspects of Blockchain Technology we are going to explore are: the potential benefits, the legal and ethical issues, Security concerns, and Social Effects. </p>

            <p> Blockchain with all its bells and whistles comes with legal and ethical implication which are cause by the implementation and adoption of the technology. The main issues we are going to focus on are: current legal view of virtual currencies, letter of the law vs intent of the law, supporting terrorism and money laundering, and the lack of privacy in the blockchain. Using the blockchain technology as a medium of exchange was first introduce in 2009 “following the publication of a white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008” (William J Luther), at first Bitcoin was nothing more than an extravagant piece of code being traded for pennies between collector and aficionados. According to William J Luther in Bitcoin and the Future of Digital Payments Bitcoins’ value “climbed to roughly $1.00 by February 2011 and then to nearly $30.00 four months later before settling down to an average of just $8.16 from July 2011 to February 2012”, this is not the first nor the only time that Bitcoin as a medium of exchange has fluctuated wildly up and down in value. Bitcoin is not money according to the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service “virtual currency is treated as property” (IRS, Notice 2014-21), like a vehicle, real state, or a computer. This is because currency is issue by governments to finance its operations and thus having the power regulate, print, and tax the currency. Bitcoin is a decentralized peer to peer currency without the backing of any government and thus it cannot be controlled by any one government. Bitcoin cannot add more currency to its numbers thus making this a deflationary currency; a Government is able to print more money to meet its obligation, which usually causes inflation within the economy. Taxes are collected with the currency issue by the government, as is written on each bill we use “This note is legal tender for all debts public and private” if you wished to do business with the government you must use its currency, governments can’t tax bitcoin within the program, as this is not a feature of bitcoin. Regulation and case law will ultimately define and shape how virtual currencies will be treated. Natural language is how law are written, however smart contract relies on strict language to execute. When using blockchain to enact and process smart contracts we must be aware of the restrictions of trying to turn law into code. Natural language is flexible and ambiguous, while computer code is strict and clear. When using code to turn certain lows with specific outcomes blockchain should help with the burden or record keeping and processing of transactions. However when we turn open-ended laws into computer code we face the unescapable reality that by turning them into code we maybe be making these laws less flexible and could distort the meaning of these laws since blindly applying the wording of the law would violate the law’s original intent. Consider how is not possible to comes up with every possible contingency to a given situation, translating law into code will not work without a process to correct any possible misuse of the technology. Terrorism and money laundering have been at the forefront of the blockchain technology. Bitcoin along with other technologies that allow for the anonymity of those transacting with it has lead to the creation of illegal marketplaces where the illegal sale of prescriptions drugs, weapons, child pornography, and drugs. Because bitcoin allows for the easy of transferring value anywhere in the world this has facilitate much of the dark market transaction thus supporting money laundering and possible terrorist activities. Privacy in the blockchain although anonymity is one of the selling features of the technology, however it really is not very anonymous. Transactions are kept in a chronological order and cryptographic signatures link blocks thus enabling block-chain to from, these in turn provide an auditable trail of transactions, significantly increasing the probability of detecting patterns that could disclose who is in the other side of the transaction. </p>
